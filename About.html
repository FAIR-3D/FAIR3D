			Welcome to my web portfolio,
			<br>
			My name is Joshua and I am a self taught 3D artist from New Zealand.
		</a>
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<a>
			For all your 3D modeling and animation needs. Whether you need a model to 3D print, a promotional video for marketing, an instructional video for your product, modeling a concept for a product to manufacture, or even a game-ready asset.
		</a>
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<a>
			I started using blender as a hobby about 3 years ago, making basic models for fun. In this time I have taught myself not only how to model, but UV wrap, Rig, texture and animate.

		<br>
		<br>

			My work has led to me getting offered a comfy office job making instructional and promotional animations for one of NZ's biggest electrical distrubutors.
		<br>
		<br>
			Growing up I had a interest in producing music, this is where I learned how to make the background music and sound effects used in my animations. 
		<br>
			I am also very interested in game development, I started using scratch when I was in university, then I later switched to GODOT. Now I am teaching myself Unreal Engine.
			
		
		</a>
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<a>

			I use a variety of different software to plan, model, texture, animate and sound design my work;

		<br>
		<br>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Blender - Modeling, animating</li>
				<li>Solidworks - CAD drawing</li>
				<li>Substance Painter - texturing</li>
				<li>FL studio - Music and sound effects</li>
				<li>Da Vinci resolve - Video editing</li>
				<li>Clipchamp - Light-weight Video editing</li>
				<li>Krita - Making labels and images</li>
				<li>Handbrake - Compressing/cropping videos</li>
			</ul>
